0.0.30
  - Start keeping changelog.

    Currently supports literal paths in .versioned-files.list,
    one main document in properties or reStructuredText format.
    And just a handful of source documents: Shell script, Makefile, Javascript,
    YAML, JSON, Coffee-Script, Ant build XML.
    Any format supporting c-style line comments or unix octotrophe comments,
    but needs to be hardcoded.

    Immediate dev plans: clean-up docs, start on branches for better
    configuration, more flexible parser.
